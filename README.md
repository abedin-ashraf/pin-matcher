# Pin Generator

This is a simple web application that generates a random PIN and allows the user to enter their guess. The application will verify if the entered PIN matches the generated PIN and provide a notification accordingly.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. You will see a PIN generator section on the left side of the page. Click the "Generate Pin" button to generate a random PIN.

3. The generated PIN will be displayed in the input field next to the "Generate Pin" button.

4. On the right side of the page, you will find an input section where you can enter your guess for the PIN. Click the buttons with numbers to enter the corresponding digits.

5. If you make a mistake, you can click the "C" button to clear the input.

6. After entering your guess, click the "Submit" button to verify the PIN.

7. If the entered PIN matches the generated PIN, a success notification will be displayed. Otherwise, a failure notification will be shown.

8. You have a limited number of attempts, which will be displayed in the "try left" section. Once you exhaust all your attempts, you won't be able to submit any more guesses.
